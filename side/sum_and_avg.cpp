#include <iostream>                     // i would love to explain what im doing here
using namespace std;                    // but sadly i couldn't care less
int main() 
{                                       // it says main, figure it out yourself einstein

int a=5,b=3,c=4,d=6,e,sum,avg;          // declaring or initializing. you figure it out

cout<<"enter the e number"<<endl;       //HMMM I WONDER WHAT C-OUT MEANSSS
                                       
cin>>e;                                 //HMMM I WONDER WHAT C-IN MEANSSS
cout<<e<<endl;
sum=a+b+c+d;                     // we are summing and taking avg of the numbers. 
avg=sum/4;                       // we dont really need a computer for 
.                                //that unless you'r a dummy like me
cout<<"the sum is "<<sum<<endl;  // scanf the shit out of the sum and avg
cout<<"the avg is "<<avg;        // i do hope you atleast know how to read XD
